# CBC TV App

This is the CBC TV application. The app has been reverse engineered from their
online services.

## What is supported

Nothing yet, initially live TV, then maybe other live programming.

## API Details

Live programming is keyed off of the following links:
* [Live channels](http://tpfeed.cbc.ca/f/ExhSPC/t_t3UKJR6MAT?pretty=true&sort=pubDate%7Cdesc)
* [Live](https://tpfeed.cbc.ca/f/ExhSPC/FNiv9xQx_BnT?q=id:*&pretty=true&sort=pubDate%7Cdesc)

## Rant

Should anyone (especially from the legal team) from the CBC come to read this,
I'd like to start by saying how very disappointing it is that these APIs are not
published. As tax payers we have a right to this content and should be able to
watch it (in the highest quality option) on whatever device we wish.

As to the quality, it is disappointing that only low-bitrate streams are
available. It would be nice if quality comparable to what is provided on BDUs
was supported through the online services.
